In this project, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Using Matplotlib to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

As we approach the equator the temperature increases.
Since data has been collected in summer the temperatures are warmer in northen hemisphire.
There is no relationship between city latitude and wind speed, cloudiness and Humidity.
